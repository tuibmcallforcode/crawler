President Kabila and his opponents will have to recalibrate strategies ahead of Bemba’s likely return. Outside powers should keep pressing Kabila to stand down and allow opposition candidates to participate.\n\nWhat’s new? On 8 June Jean-Pierre Bemba, a charismatic Congolese leader and fierce rival of President Joseph Kabila, was acquitted by the International Criminal Court’s appeals chamber of a 2016 war crimes conviction. His likely re-entry into Congolese politics will shake up the campaign ahead of elections slated for December 2018.\n\nWhy does it matter? Bemba has the profile to contest the presidency. For President Kabila, whose attempts to retain power face stiff domestic and international opposition – or for a successor Kabila anoints – Bemba represents a threat. But his return will also complicate the Congolese opposition’s efforts to unite behind a single presidential contender.\n\nWhat should be done? International actors need to maintain pressure for elections at the end of 2018 without Kabila. If Kabila stands aside and prospects of a genuine contest for power improve, credible polls and commitments by contenders to avoid inflammatory campaign language and pursue post-election grievances peacefully will be critical.",

The municipality of Carmen, North Cotabato is Soccsksargen's pilot site.\n\n“We invite the public to post photos or videos doing the simulation drill or showing what they do to be prepared for earthquakes and other hazards,” Morante added, asking everyone to tag OCD XII in their status update about NSED on Facebook. \n\nThe posting of photos and videos of the drill must contain #BidaAngHanda across all social media platforms, said OCD XII information officer Jorie Mae Balmediano. \n\nShe also articulated the spoken statement that all participants must recite in the video: “Sa June 21, 2018, ganap na alas-dos ng hapon, sama-sama tayong mag DUCK, COVER and HOLD, dahil bida ang handa!” \n\nIn addition, she said agencies can showcase on their videos or photos what other initiatives they had already made in order to be ready when calamity occurs. \n\nMorante believes that people’s sharing videos and photos of their “earthquake drill experiences” is one way of translating their commitment to help government achieve disaster preparedness and resiliency for the long haul. \n\nShe said their cooperation only shows that they are supporting the nationwide earthquake drill, which is conducted quarterly every year.

            "body": "Seven years have passed since the 311 Eastern Japan Earthquake. The Taiwan Red Cross has already completed its visit of reconstruction projects in Fukushima, Miyagi, and Iwate, areas hit hardest by the earthquake. As of this year, 62 public housing projects have been completed in Iwate Prefecture, providing housing for 330 families. However, due to the preparation of the Tokyo Olympics, 372 households are still under construction. A total of 702 households are expected to be completed by 2020.\n\nOn the eve of the seventh anniversary of the Eastern Japan Earthquake, the Taiwan Red Cross was invited by the Red Cross Society of Japan to participate in the “Eastern Japan Earthquake and Tsunami Partner Conference” in Tokyo with the IFCR and ICRC. 23 Red Cross societies from across the world joined and discussed important issues such as community resilience to disasters. In order gain a deeper understanding of the recovery situation, the Red Cross Society of Japan arranged for Red Cross societies to travel to Iwate, Miyagi, and Fukushima Prefectures to visit the sites of reconstruction projects.\n\nAfter the earthquake and tsunami struck in 2011, the Taiwan Red Cross actively assisted in emergency relief efforts in Fukushima, Miyagi, and Iwate, areas that were hit hardest. The Taiwan Red Cross assisted with providing shelter, medical care, and education. The Taiwan Red Cross also supported the Red Cross Society of Japan in the implementation of care programs for the vulnerable and activities to keep warm. Projects that have been completed at present include: 68 public housing units for the elderly in Soma City and Shinchi Town, Fukushima Prefecture; the Miyagi Prefectural Government Office; Minamisanri Hospital; Kesennuma City Citizens Welfare Center; two nursery schools in Yamadacho, Iwate Prefecture; two nursery schools in Otsuka-cho; and 18 public housing units in 18 locations. Because of delays due to the Tokyo Olympics, projects will likely only be completed in 2020.\n\nThe Eastern Japan Earthquake resulted in 15,893 deaths with 2,565 people missing, the destruction of 535 square kilometers of land, and damages to 400,000 homes, 4,198 roads, and 116 bridges. The Taiwan Red Cross donated more than 2.5 million TWD to assist with relief efforts.",

The Taiwan Red Cross has already completed its visit of reconstruction projects in Fukushima, Miyagi, and Iwate, areas hit hardest by the earthquake. As of this year, 62 public housing projects have been completed in Iwate Prefecture, providing housing for 330 families. However, due to the preparation of the Tokyo Olympics, 372 households are still under construction. A total of 702 households are expected to be completed by 2020.</p>\n\n<p>On the eve of the seventh anniversary of the Eastern Japan Earthquake, the Taiwan Red Cross was invited by the Red Cross Society of Japan to participate in the “Eastern Japan Earthquake and Tsunami Partner Conference” in Tokyo with the IFCR and ICRC. 23 Red Cross societies from across the world joined and discussed important issues such as community resilience to disasters. In order gain a deeper understanding of the recovery situation, the Red Cross Society of Japan arranged for Red Cross societies to travel to Iwate, Miyagi, and Fukushima Prefectures to visit the sites of reconstruction projects.</p>\n\n<p>After the earthquake and tsunami struck in 2011, the Taiwan Red Cross actively assisted in emergency relief efforts in Fukushima, Miyagi, and Iwate, areas that were hit hardest. The Taiwan Red Cross assisted with providing shelter, medical care, and education. The Taiwan Red Cross also supported the Red Cross Society of Japan in the implementation of care programs for the vulnerable and activities to keep warm. Projects that have been completed at present include: 68 public housing units for the elderly in Soma City and Shinchi Town, Fukushima Prefecture; the Miyagi Prefectural Government Office; Minamisanri Hospital; Kesennuma City Citizens Welfare Center; two nursery schools in Yamadacho, Iwate Prefecture; two nursery schools in Otsuka-cho; and 18 public housing units in 18 locations. Because of delays due to the Tokyo Olympics, projects will likely only be completed in 2020.</p>\n\n<p>The Eastern Japan Earthquake resulted in 15,893 deaths with 2,565 people missing, the destruction of 535 square kilometers of land, and damages to 400,000 homes, 4,198 roads, and 116 bridges. The Taiwan Red Cross donated more than 2.5 million TWD to assist with relief efforts.</p>\n"

The number of people registered as staying in care centres continues to fluctuate, and the overall number of affected communities may rise as new information becomes available. \n\nAccording to latest information, most schools in Hela have resumed classes at the start of May. \n\nThe Disaster Management Team (DMT) undertook a mid-term operational review of the current DMT Earthquake Response Plan from 17-18 May in Port Moresby. The objective was to take stock of humanitarian partners’ response, identify need for any course correction for their response; and outline an agreed approach to transition from response to recovery. Aside from humanitarian partners, the government and key private sector participated in the review. Key outcomes include a broad confirmation of current sectoral and coordination priorities and an agreement of the need to initiate recovery activities, where possible, while response activities continued. A report of the operational review is currently being finalised.  \n\nSince 28 March, most humanitarian programmes in and around Tari, the provincial capital of Hela province, have been suspended due to increased tension and inter-communal fighting. Many partners have temporarily relocated humanitarian staff to other locations, including to the Southern Highlands provincial capital, Mendi, in view of the situation. Due to restricted humanitarian access, an operational planning group for land-based relief activities in Hela province was established on 16 May. The group, comprising implementing agencies/organisations, will focus on close coordination between implementing agencies/organisations and developing a joint/integrated programme for target locations within Hela province. The Hela operational planning group is working closely with the PNG Government to identify down-scaled permissible locations based on latest information of the security situation in Hela province. Land-based relief operations in Hela are expected to resume incrementally from early June.",

The number of people registered as staying in care centres continues to fluctuate, and the overall number of affected communities may rise as new information becomes available. </p>\n\n<p>According to latest information, most schools in Hela have resumed classes at the start of May. </p>\n\n<p>The Disaster Management Team (DMT) undertook a mid-term operational review of the current DMT Earthquake Response Plan from 17-18 May in Port Moresby. The objective was to take stock of humanitarian partners’ response, identify need for any course correction for their response; and outline an agreed approach to transition from response to recovery. Aside from humanitarian partners, the government and key private sector participated in the review. Key outcomes include a broad confirmation of current sectoral and coordination priorities and an agreement of the need to initiate recovery activities, where possible, while response activities continued. A report of the operational review is currently being finalised.  </p>\n\n<p>Since 28 March, most humanitarian programmes in and around Tari, the provincial capital of Hela province, have been suspended due to increased tension and inter-communal fighting. Many partners have temporarily relocated humanitarian staff to other locations, including to the Southern Highlands provincial capital, Mendi, in view of the situation. Due to restricted humanitarian access, an operational planning group for land-based relief activities in Hela province was established on 16 May. The group, comprising implementing agencies/organisations, will focus on close coordination between implementing agencies/organisations and developing a joint/integrated programme for target locations within Hela province. The Hela operational planning group is working closely with the PNG Government to identify down-scaled permissible locations based on latest information of the security situation in Hela province. Land-based relief operations in Hela are expected to resume incrementally from early June.</p>\n"

The full report can be accessed at https://tinyurl.com/y7a4vgzd.\n\n• Humanitarian access to Tari, an area close to the epicentre of the earthquake, is restricted due to security concerns.
