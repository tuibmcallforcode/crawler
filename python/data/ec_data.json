        "content": "A team of eight European experts will fly to Guatemala on Saturday to support national authorities after the multiple eruptions of Volcan de Fuego since 3 June. The team is being deployed though the European Union Civil Protection Mechanism, following a request for assistance issued by the Government of Guatemala.\"We are continuing to support Guatemala following the recent volcano eruptions. Our help through the Union Civil Protection Mechanism is a concrete example of European solidarity to the people of Guatemala and of our readiness to support people in need anywhere in the world, wherever a disaster strikes,\" said Commissioner for Humanitarian Aid and Crisis Management Christos Stylianides.The European team, whose technical expertise ranges from monitoring of volcanic mudflows (lahars), to risk management and early warning systems, will support the Guatemalan national authorities in assessing the situation on the ground and the impact of the eruption, as well as providing recommendations for future preparedness measures.The deployment of European experts comes on top of the emergency assistance the EU has provided to Guatemala since the volcano erupted. The deployment of European experts comes on top of the \u20ac400 000 in emergency assistance, which the EU has provided to Guatemala since the volcano erupted to provide displaced populations in the worst-hit departments with health, water and sanitation assistance, as well as psychosocial support. The EU's Copernicus satellite mapping service was also activated upon request of the Government of Guatemala and has produced 18 maps so far.BackgroundOn 3 June 2018, Guatemala's Volcan de Fuego erupted, triggering floods of lava and emission of ash and small rocks. The eruption affected different areas of the departments of Chimaltenango, Sacatep\u00e9quez, and Escuintla. On 20 June, the volcano was still reported to be active, with four to five weak explosions recorded every hour.According to the latest figures published by the Guatemalan national authorities, the eruption has left 110 dead, with 197 people still missing. Approximately 12 800 people have been evacuated, and an estimated 3 600 are currently hosted in 17 official shelters.This EU Civil Protection Mechanism is managed by the European Commission's Emergency Response Coordination Centre (ERCC), which operates on a 24/7 basis and plays a key role as a coordination hub to facilitate a coherent European response during emergencies inside and outside Europe.",

        "content": "Following the devastating floods and landslides which struck Sri Lanka over the last weeks, the European Commission gave \u20ac160 000 in humanitarian funding to bring emergency assistance to the communities affected by the recent floods. Some 17 500 people in the seven most affected districts of the country will benefit from aid. Priority will be given to those who have been displaced.This EU funding supports the Sri Lanka Red Cross Society in delivering relief assistance to those families who are currently living in temporary shelters or evacuation centres. They will receive cash grants which will enable them to purchase essential households items. Priority will be given to access to clean water and sanitation, particularly through the cleaning of wells with contaminated water. First aid and medical services will also be provided, together with hygiene awareness sessions to avoid the spread of waterborne diseases.The funding is part of the EU\u2019s overall contribution to the Disaster Relief Emergency Fund (DREF) of the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC). This fund was established in 1985 and is supported by contributions from donors. Each time a National Red Cross or Red Crescent Society needs immediate financial support to respond to a disaster, the IFRC allocates grants from the Fund, which can then be replenished by the donors.Since May 19, the southwest monsoon weather conditions have caused heavy rainfalls in the southwest parts of Sri Lanka, triggering floods and landslides in various locations.\u00a0 According to information released by the national disaster management centre, close to 175 000 people have been affected across 19 districts, and 26 people killed. Puttalam, Gampaha, Ratnapura, Colombo, Kurunegala, Kalutara, and Kegalle are amongst the worst-affected districts.",

This year's EU Civil Protection Forum has been a great success and this is one of the concrete outcomes.\"Under the new arrangement, Tunisia will benefit from training for experts, the setting up of joint emergency response plans as well as closer cooperation with the EU's Copernicus satellite system. The move is part of the EU's increasing cooperation with Tunisia in a number of fields.This year's Civil Protection Forum gathered together a wide community of decision-makers, disaster management experts and first-line responders to exchange best practices and enhance their cooperation at all levels. Participants in the Forum also discussed the Commission's\u00a0rescEU proposal\u00a0to further strengthen Europe's ability to tackle disasters that was presented in November 2017.BackgroundWhenever the scale of an emergency overwhelms the response capabilities of a country, the EU Civil Protection Mechanism enables coordinated assistance from its Participating States. These include all EU Member States, as well as Iceland, the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, Montenegro, Norway, Serbia and Turkey. Cooperation arrangements signed with additional countries, such as Tunisia, formalise cooperation and thereby strengthen joint response to natural and man-made disasters.Following the agreement with Algeria in December 2016, this is the second time that an administrative arrangement has been signed with a country from the southern neighbourhood of the EU.",

        "content": "The European Commission has drawn up a landscape of the main disaster risks Europe faces today. Flooding, extreme weather and critical infrastructure disruption are among the top five risks across the European Union, as identified by Member States. Interdependencies are growing in a risk landscape that is increasingly influenced by climate change.\nImproving the understanding of disaster risks in Europe is an important step towards effective disaster risk reduction, and constitutes the basis for planning emergency preparedness and response to emergencies and disasters in Europe.\nThe Overview of Risks is one of the disaster prevention measures foreseen under the Union Civil Protection Mechanism. At the same time, it represents one of the European Commission's main commitments set out in the Action Plan for the implementation of the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction.\nIts launch coincides with the participation of the European Commission at the Global Platform for Disaster Risk Reduction, held from 22 to 26 May in Cancun, Mexico.\nThe Overview of Risks compiles outcomes of disaster risk assessments undertaken at national levels across Europe and cross-references them with scientific and other data. The analysis highlights the predominant attention given to disaster risks such as flood, extreme weather, forest fire, industrial accidents and the disruption of critical infrastructure.\nOther disaster risks such as pandemics, radiological accidents, terrorism, cybercrime, earthquakes and animal diseases are also of particular importance to emergency management authorities across Europe.\nEU-funded research addressing these and other risks contributes to better risk and disaster management and the anticipation of new and emerging risks.",

The estimated number of people that could be infected is currently 400. Four health areas are affected in Bas-Uele province.Responding to the Ebola outbreak in the Northeast of the DRC, Commissioner for Humanitarian Aid and Crisis Management and EU Ebola Coordinator Christos Stylianides affirmed EU support:\"Following the declaration of an\u00a0Ebola outbreak in the Northeast of the DRC, the\u00a0EU is fully committed to provide all support necessary.\u00a0The national\u00a0authorities, with the support of the World Health Organisation (WHO), and the European Commission's experts in the country as well as international medical NGOs, have set in motion initial measures to respond to the situation.The European Commission's\u00a0Emergency response Coordination Centre (ERCC) is taking necessary preparedness measures for a potential EU intervention in case the European Medical Corps and logistical capacities would be needed. In this regard we are\u00a0in close contact with our Member States.In these early days of the outbreak our priority must be to maintain close and efficient coordination with the national authorities, the WHO, EU Member States, international partners and NGOs on the ground.The EU was at the forefront of the response to the Ebola outbreak in Western Africa in 2013-2016. This new outbreak is a stark reminder that we can never let our guard down.\u00a0Vigilance, early warning, coordination and preparedness are the best tools to prevent further spread of the outbreak.\"It is a small and manageable outbreak and appears to be geographically\u00a0limited. The DRC\u00a0has experience with handling Ebola; however, investigations are ongoing to assess the full extent of the outbreak.In response to the 2014-2015 outbreaks, the European Union, together with its Member States, has made close to \u20ac2 billion in aid available to help contain the spread of Ebola in West Africa.",

The disaster risk forum is a key event to bring public, private, NGO and international stakeholders together to ensure we invest in reducing the risk and impact of disasters throughout Europe.\" The European Commission also supports disaster prevention and preparedness efforts of participating states through the EU Civil Protection Mechanism, of which Turkey is a member.\"During my visit in Turkey, I will also take the opportunity to see the impact of the EU's humanitarian cash assistance programme which has now reached over 400,000 refugees.\" Commissioner Stylianides added. \u00a0The Commission's largest ever humanitarian aid programme in Turkey worth \u20ac348 million was launched in September 2016. Known as the Emergency Social Safety Net (ESSN), the scheme provides a monthly electronic cash grant to the most vulnerable refugees.BackgroundDisaster risk prevention is increasingly incorporated within key EU policy areas, including health, environment, climate change adaptation, development, cohesion, agriculture, transport, energy, research and innovation.The EU supports the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction (2015-2030), which was agreed by 187 UN Member States in March 2015. An Action Plan adopted by the Commission in June 2016 outlines the next European steps in implementing the framework. It proposes activities on risk knowledge, risk investments, disaster preparedness and resilience worldwideTurkey is currently hosting\u00a0over 3 million registered refugees, which significantly impacts host communities and budget resources. The majority of refugees have fled the conflict in Syria \u2013 the world's largest humanitarian crisis since World War II.The European Commission's Civil Protection and Humanitarian Aid Operations\u00a0supports emergency humanitarian assistance programmes, primarily focussed on life-saving activities in various sectors, including health, food security and livelihood support, water and sanitation, protection\u00a0and education in emergencies.In November 2015, the EU launched the Facility for Refugees in Turkey to deliver\u00a0support to Syrian and other refugees and host communities in close cooperation with Turkish authorities. The Facility provides \u20ac3 billion in funding for 2016 and 2017, for both humanitarian and non-humanitarian projects.The flagship initiative under the Facility for the Refugees in Turkey is the Emergency Social Safety Net (ESSN). Funded by the EU, the\u00a0ESSN is a single card social assistance scheme that will allow up to 1 million of the most vulnerable refugees to meet pressing basic needs.",

        "content": "In response to the heavy rains and floods that affected over 32 500 people in Egypt between end of October and beginning of November 2016, the European Commission provided \u20ac166 000 humanitarian funding to help the most vulnerable families.\u00a0This EU-funding supports the Egyptian Red Crescent in delivering relief assistance to meet the immediate needs of up to 10 000 people affected by the floods. The funding will help refill the stocks of blankets, mattresses, pillows, plastic sheeting and other urgently needed items that had been given out during the first hours of the disaster. EU funding will help finance the first aid response as well as hygiene promotion and kits to reduce the risk of water and sanitation related diseases. The funding is part of the EU's overall contribution to the Disaster Relief Emergency Fund (DREF) of the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC).Heavy rainfall and floods hit several governorates of Egypt (South Sinai, Red Sea, Sohag, Qena, and Assuit), killing 26 people and injuring 72. Houses were washed away, main roads closed and telephone and power lines cut, especially in Red Sea Governorate. At least 6 500 families - approximately 32 500 people - have been affected by the floods and need emergency shelter, water, sanitation and food.BackgroundThe European Union together with its Member States is the world's leading donor of humanitarian aid. Relief assistance is an expression of European solidarity towards people in need around the world. It aims to save lives, prevent and alleviate human suffering, and safeguard the integrity and human dignity of populations affected by natural disasters and man-made crises. The European Commission, through its Humanitarian Aid and Civil Protection department (ECHO), helps over 120 million victims of conflicts and disasters every year.The European Commission has signed a \u20ac3 million humanitarian delegation agreement with the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) to support the Federation's Disaster Relief Emergency Fund (DREF). Funds from the DREF are mainly allocated to \u201csmall-scale\u201d disasters \u2013 those that do not give rise to a formal international appeal.The Disaster Relief Emergency Fund was established in 1985 and is supported by contributions from donors. Each time a National Red Cross or Red Crescent Society needs immediate financial support to respond to a disaster, it can request funds from the DREF. For small-scale disasters, the IFRC allocates grants from the Fund, which can then be replenished by the donors. The delegation agreement between the IFRC and the European Commission enables the latter to replenish the DREF for agreed operations (that fit in with its humanitarian mandate) up to a total of \u20ac3 million.",

According to Monique Pariat, the logistics chain \"is vital for all sectors of humanitarian response\". It is the second biggest recipient of capacity building support of the European Commission's humanitarian aid department (ECHO), which also provides quality logistics services through the EU Civil Protection Mechanism's specialised teams and voluntary pool.With increased recognition also comes more responsibility to deliver. Logistics are a significant part of humanitarian costs and are key to the success of operations.

The country is particularly at risk to water borne diseases such as cholera, and there are fears that floods induced by hurricane Matthew could spread the disease.Weak infrastructure further impedes the country's resilience to natural hazards. Haiti has long been the poorest country in the Western hemisphere, with 58.5% of the population living under the poverty line.\u00a0Access\u00a0to basic healthcare services is limited.

With more rain on its way, the key priority now is to make sure people are safe \u2013 and then to help them rebuild their livelihoods. Our new humanitarian funding will help provide immediate help to those in need through our partners on the ground.\"The aid will be targeted at providing essential support such as food assistance and nutrition, shelter, water and sanitation. This is a first funding decision and further support could be allocated depending on needs on the ground.BackgroundSituation in Myanmar/Burma:Myanmar/Burma has been experiencing heavy torrential rains since the end of June 2015, associated with the Southwest Monsoon system which marks the start of the rainy season and lasts until October. The most affected regions are: Sagaing Region, Kachin and Shan States. Thousands have been displaced and have lost crops and other livelihood assets, along with their homes. Drinking water ponds and wells have been contaminated and infrastructure such as bridges and roads have been flooded or destroyed. To aggravate the situation further, the tropical cyclone 'Komen' hit Rakhine State between 30 July and 1 August, bringing more rainfall, severe winds and a storm surge in its wake. Reports indicate that 69 people lost their lives, with some 259 000 people affected across 12 of Myanmar's 14 regions since June 2015.Situation in Bangladesh:Bangladesh has also seen heavy floods and landslides as a result of pre-monsoon heavy rains occurring during the last week of June in the districts of Chittagong, Bandarban and Cox\u2019s Bazar in the Southeast of Bangladesh. A second period of heavy rain from 22- 27 July caused new floods, landslides and further displacements. The tropical cyclone Komen has also crossed the same districts leaving more than 320 000 people displaced in cyclone shelters in Cox's Bazar and Chittagong.In addition to the emergency funding, the EU's Civil Protection Mechanism has been activated at the request of the government of Myanmar.

In addition to the disaster response in the Philippines, key assistance has been provided, among other, to Portugal and Bosnia and Herzegovina to cope with overwhelming forest fires during the summer, and to Jordan and Bulgaria to support the shelter and medical needs of Syrian refugees.BackgroundThe ERCC is operational on a 24/7 basis, capable of dealing with up to three simultaneous emergencies in different time zones. Upon a request by the country affected or by the UN, it dispatches assessment and coordination experts to disaster areas, provides monitoring and early warning on upcoming disasters, and facilitates the transport of Member States' assistance in response to major emergencies.The ERCC also supports close coordination between the different Commission services involved in the response to emergencies where a multi-sectoral response is needed.The ERCC is the \"operational heart\" of the EU Civil Protection Mechanism. The key goal of the EU Civil Protection Mechanism is to facilitate co-operation in civil protection assistance interventions in the event of major emergencies. In addition to the 28 EU Member States, the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway partake in the EU Civil Protection Mechanism. The participating states pool resources that can be made available to disaster-hit countries and share best practices in disaster management.",

        "content": "The European Commission today has announced it will give \u20ac142 million in humanitarian funds to the Sahel region of Africa in 2014, which is once again suffering because of a severe food and nutrition crisis this year. In addition, many people in Mali are in need of humanitarian aid as a result of the situation in the North.In 2014, severe acute malnutrition rates continue to surpass emergency thresholds in many regions of Chad, Niger, Mauritania, Burkina Faso, Mali, Senegal and Nigeria. The lean season, the difficult months between two harvests when food and resources become scarce, has started early for many in the Sahel. One and a half million children are at high risk of severe malnutrition this year.The EU funding will provide \u20ac57 million in emergency relief for people affected by the overall Sahel food and nutrition crisis, \u20ac28 million to assist victims of the Mali crisis, \u20ac7.5 million for the food crisis situation in Nigeria, where the North is experiencing the most challenging situation; \u20ac29.5 million for Chad, which is in a complex crisis with an increasing number of refugees; and \u20ac2 million for North Cameroon. An additional \u20ac18 million is planned in EU development funding to provide relief and rehabilitation assistance to build resilience in northern Mali.This funding will prioritise life-saving nutrition care for children and mothers and provide food assistance, access to basic health services and clean water for the most vulnerable people. It will also ensure that hundreds of thousands of refugees and internally displaced people in West African countries continue to receive vital aid.",

The restoration of electricity supply is being made difficult by the continuing bad weather, hence the need for emergency generators.Commissioner Georgieva commented: \"We've seen an impressive gesture of European solidarity with this immediate response to an emergency affecting thousands of citizens in one of our Member States. This shift assistance operation is just the latest demonstration of the value of our cooperation in civil protection.\"Other countries, participating in the EU Civil Protection Mechanism, are also exploring means to help. The European Emergency Response Coordination Centre continues to work around the clock to coordinate the relief effort and give further support if needed.",

Typhoon Haiyan (known locally as Yolanda) has intensified its strength, with winds of over 270km/h, and is expected to make landfall on the Eastern coast in a few hours. Up to 10 million people may be affected. The European Commission is monitoring the situation and a team of ECHO humanitarian experts is on stand-by to conduct a needs assessment as soon as the cyclone hits the archipelago.The Emergency Response and Coordination Centre of the European Commission's Humanitarian Aid and Civil Protection department ECHO is closely observing the current developments. Typhoon Haiyan (Yolanda) has reached the equivalent of a Hurricane Category 5, and will enter the archipelago through Samar and Leyte provinces in the Visayas possibly causing heavy rainfall, flash floods and landslides. Most of the Government offices and school classes have been suspended and thousands of residents on the coast are being evacuated - including survivors of the island communities struck by the 7.2 magnitude earthquake on 15 October, who were staying in tent shelters.The Philippines is one of the most disaster-prone countries in the world, with 15 to 20 cyclones a year and major seismic upheavals, among other natural catastrophes. In 2013 alone, the European Union has provided significant humanitarian assistance to the archipelago: \u20ac2.5 million have just been made available for the response to the earthquake in Bohol; for \u00a0Typhoon Bopha (Pablo), a total of \u20ac10 million have been released to help rebuild the communities devastated by the cyclone hit South-Eastern Mindanao in December 2012; following flooding caused by Typhoon Trami (Maring) in August ECHO committed \u20ac200 000 to help those affected, and \u20ac300 000 were allocated in early October to assist those displaced by the conflict in Zamboanga.",

The five day exercise co-funded by the European Commission's Humanitarian Aid and Civil Protection department ECHO has brought together over 30 organisations working in the field of humanitarian aid and civil protection.UN agencies, NGOs, governmental organisations, military, civil protection agencies, and EU Civil Protection are testing the response, coordination and cooperation during a simulated international humanitarian and civil protection operation. The scenario revolves around a hurricane and sudden-onset flooding of the border region where joint response planning and mutual support on the ground is crucial for saving lives.According to the situation, the hurricane resulted in 12 000 deaths. Infrastructure is heavily damaged and the affected population is forced to settle in spontaneous camps. No telecommunication, electricity and water supply is available. The flooding has created a number of areas where people are in need of rescuing by either boats or helicopters.TRIPLEX 2013 is managed by the Danish Emergency Management Agency (DEMA) and the German Federal Agency for Technical Relief (THW). The EU co-finances 85% of the exercise and participates in it with an EU Civil Protection team of experts. Furthermore, the EU Emergency Response Centre (ERC) is coordinating the response operations with all the organisations involved in the exercise.The exercise provides learning and training opportunities focusing on efficient cooperation in humanitarian operations between civil protection, humanitarian organisations and military resources.",

This is why we need to scale up our efforts to provide a coordinated European disaster response in solidarity with the affected countries and populations to save lives and help the most vulnerable. As the central element of this, the European Commission has today opened its new Emergency Response Centre (ERC) in Brussels.At the centre of the European Disaster Response Capacity, the ERC is a coordination hub, monitoring events, disasters and crises in real time, ready to respond to multiple disasters simultaneously. Its task is to ensure better-coordinated, faster and more efficient disaster response to the benefit of European citizens and the victims of disasters around the world.The Centre, based at the European Commission, is staffed 24/7, and therefore is able to deal with several simultaneous emergencies in different time zones. It is receiving and analyzing appeals for assistance from affected countries and serves as a hub to support coordination at various levels: the European Commission, Member States, the affected country, humanitarian partners and civil protection teams deployed to the field. This can ensure the European assistance meets the real needs on the disaster scene and that there is no unnecessary and expensive duplication of efforts.Commissioner Georgieva, Commissioner for International Cooperation, Humanitarian Aid and Crisis Response, said \"With the increasing frequency and complexity of disasters, ensuring a coordinated and immediate response is an essential part of any life-saving action. We have established the Emergency Response Centre to enable the EU and its Member States to respond to overwhelming natural and man-made disasters in a more timely and efficient manner.\"Based within the European Commission's Humanitarian Aid and Civil Protection department (ECHO), the ERC will take on functions from the current Monitoring and Information Centre to help deliver a faster and more efficient response to natural and man-made disasters and crises.",
